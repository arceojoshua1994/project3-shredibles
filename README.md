# project3-shredibles

## Description

In this last and final project, we decided to agree on developing an e-commerce webiste. One that sells products for the target audience of fitness enthusiast with a combination of cannabis. This website crosses all the marks of using the required database of GraphQL along with Node.js and Express.js server. Due to previous lessons, we were able to re-engineer previous code to fit the ideal website of our dreams.
